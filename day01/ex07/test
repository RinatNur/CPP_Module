TextTest is an open source tool for text-based functional testing.
This means running a program in lots of different ways from the command line,
and using the text output produced as a means of controlling the behaviour of that application.
Also on this site are StoryText and CaptureMock, which aid in GUI testing and mocking respectively.
They do not depend on TextTest in any way but are well suited to being used together with it.
